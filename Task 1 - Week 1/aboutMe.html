                <p class="bio">Hey, I’m Mulanga from Tembisa — a passionate creative, tech enthusiast, and someone who truly loves God. My faith is the core of who I am, and it guides me in everything I do, from the way I live to the way I create. I believe that purpose and innovation can go hand in hand, and I’m all about using my gifts to build things that matter.
                    I'm deeply into app development, coding, and exploring how technology can solve real problems and bring people together. Whether I’m working on a new app idea, learning something new in the tech space, or just getting creative with design, I do it all with purpose and passion. I’m always pushing to grow and use tech as a tool to inspire, uplift, and make a difference — while staying rooted in my faith.   
                    This is more than just a career path for me — it’s a calling. And I’m excited to keep building, learning, and walking this journey with God at the center.</p>
